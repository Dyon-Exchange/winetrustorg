  {
    ques: `What exactly is WineTrust?`,
    ans: `WineTrust is a protocol which is being rolled out in a number of the highest-quality physical
        warehouses around the world.  WineTrust warehouses operate the latest security technology to make owning fine wine and spirits much safer and more secure.`
  },
  {
    ques: `How is WineTrust different from traditional warehouses?`,
    ans: `WineTrust is a totally new concept.  Any case or bottle being deposited into WineTrust is recorded on an independently verifiable public ledger.  WineTrust is also a foundation which is owned by its users.`
  },
  {
    ques: `Is WineTrust really more secure than normal merchant-run warehouses?`,
    ans: `Yes.  This is because all the assets secured in WineTrust are independently recorded on a public ledger which is not controlled or even influenced by any merchant.  In addition, the governance rights given to users mean that users of WineTrust will have significant influence over how it is run.`
  },
  {
    ques: `Are there any other benefits to storing my wine/spirits in WineTrust?`,
    ans: `We believe that WineTrust will become the ‘gold standard’ for long-term storage of the highest quality fine wines and spirits.  The benefits of: i) independent recording of title, ii) ownership of the protocol by its users and iii) the ability to move assets around the emerging Web 3.0 economy are huge benefits which transform the experience of owning fine wine/spirits.`
  },
  {
    ques: `What does WineTrust being ‘owned by its members’ actually mean?`,
    ans: `In the future, anyone depositing wine or spirits into WineTrust will receive digital tokens which will give them benefits such as reduced storage.   But of perhaps greater importance, WineTrust users will also have significance ‘governance’ rights over how the system is run.`
  },
  {
    ques: `Can I remove my wine/spirits from WineTrust at any time?`,
    ans: `Of course.  You can submit a redemption request at any time and withdraw your wine/spirits.`
  },
  {
    ques: `Can I see my assets in WineTrust?`,
    ans: `Absolutely.  All users of WineTrust will have a login which will show them what they hold, together with information about the market value and condition reports etc.`
  },
  {
    ques: `How can I get my wine/spirits portfolio moved to WineTrust?`,
    ans: `Simply contact us via the sign-up form in the Contact section and someone will be in touch to arrange the movement.  In the future, you will be able to direct your wine to go straight to WineTrust from merchant members’ online checkouts.`
  },
  {
    ques: `What is an ‘NFT’? And why is these useful?`,
    ans: `‘NFT’ stands for “non-fungible token”.  This means that your case or bottle of fine wine or spirits is recorded as a distinct asset on a public ledger.  Once it is, you can move it seamlessly around the Web 3.0 digital world, listing it for sale on digital asset marketplace or capitalising on its value in decentralised finance (‘Defi’) protocols. `
